Lesson 73 

The way to King Street

Last week Mrs. Mills went to London.
She does not know London very well, and she lost her way.
Suddenly, she saw a man near a bus stop.
"I can ask him the way," She said to herself.
"Excuse me," she said.
"Can you tell me the way to King Street, please?"
The man smiled pleasantly.
He did not understand English!
He spoke German. He was a tourist.
Then he put his hand into his pocket, and look out a phrasebook.
He opened the book and found a phrase.
He read the phrase slowly. "I am sorry," he said. "I do not speak English."


Lesson 75

Uncomfortable shoes

Do you have any shoes like these?
What size?
Size five.
What colour?
Black.
I'm sorry. We don't have any.
But my sister bought this pair last month.
Did she buy them here?
No, she bought them in the U.S.
We had some shoes like those a month ago, but we don't have any now.
Can you get a pair for me, please?
I'm afraid that I can't. They were in fashion last year and the year before last. But they're not in fashion this year.
These shoes are in fashion now.
They look very uncomfortable.
They are very uncomfortable. But women always wear uncomfortable shoes!


Lesson 77 

Terrible toothache

Good morning, Mr. Croft.
Good morning, nurse.
I want to see the dentist, please.
Do you have an appointment?
No, I don't.
Is it urgent?
Yes, it is. It's very urgent. I feel awful. I have a terrible toothache.
Can you come at 10 a.m. on Monday, April 24th?
I must see the dentist now, nurse.
The dentist is very busy at the moment. Can you come at 2 p.m.?
That's very late. Can the dentist see me now?
I'm afraid that he can't, Mr. Croft. Can't you wait till this afternoon?
I can wait, but my toothache can't!
