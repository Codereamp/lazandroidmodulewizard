Tutorial: How to get your signed release Apk
          warning: you need a google developer account!
 
1)Edit/change the project file "keytool_input.txt" to representative information:"

.Your  google account keystore password: 123456
.Re-enter/confirm the keystore password: 123456
 
.Your first and last name: MyFirstName MyLastName

.Your Organizational unit: MyDevelopmentUnit

.Your Organization name: MyCompany

.Your City or Locality: MyCity

.Your State or Province: MT

.The two-letter country code: BR

.All correct: y

.Your key password for this Apk alias-key: 123456


2)If you are using "Ant" then edit/change "ant.properties" according, too!


3) Execute the [project] command "release-keystore.bat" or "release-keystore.sh" or "release-keystore-macos.sh" to get the "appniceproject1-release.keystore"
            warning: the file "appniceproject1-release.keystore" should be created only once [per application] otherwise it will fail!
 

4 [Gradle]: execute the [project] command "gradle-local-apksigner.bat" [or .sh] to get the [release] signed Apk! (thanks to TR3E!)
            hint: look for [project] folder "...\build\outputs\apk\release"
 
4 [Ant]: execute the [project] command "ant-build-release.bat" [.sh] to get the [release] signed Apk!"
         hint: look for [project] folder "...\bin"


Success! You can now upload your nice "AppNiceProject1-release.apk" to "Google Play" store!

Hi,

...I have added a Gradle option into build.gradle:

    splits {
        abi {
            enable true
            reset()
            include 'arm64-v8a'
            universalApk false
        }
    }


To make a combined apk, build with Gradle use [something like] this:

    splits {
        abi {
            enable true
            reset()
            include 'armeabi-v7a','arm64-v8a'
            universalApk true
        }
    }


....  Thanks to All!
....  Special thanks to TR3E and DonAlfredo!
