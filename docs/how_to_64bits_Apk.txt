Hi,

...I have added a Gradle option into build.gradle:

    splits {
        abi {
            enable true
            reset()
            include 'arm64-v8a'
            universalApk false
        }
    }


To make a combined apk, build with Gradle use [something like] this:

    splits {
        abi {
            enable true
            reset()
            include 'armeabi-v7a','arm64-v8a'
            universalApk true
        }
    }
